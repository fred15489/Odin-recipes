# Odin-recipes
My first project in foundations called Recipes.

This was a fun little project to build out a 
recipes website. I learned a lot about git and github as I commited often, usually
after a page was creaated and linked to 
index.html. I got practice on trying to write 
good commit comments, although I feel there is much
left to be desired on that par, I will continue to 
improve on this as I get more practice.

I also got to put into practice all that I have learned
in foundations thus far, like, biolerplates,
headings, paragraphs, alternative text, images, links, unordered and ordered ists.

I am enjoying the journey and look forward to more challenges ahead.
